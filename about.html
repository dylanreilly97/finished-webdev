<h4>  I have always had a big interest in the field of design of and creativity. Drawing, designing and taking pictures have always been some of my favourite hobbies.
I am currently a first year student in the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology.<br>Since taking on this course I have developed a huge interest in the field of graphic
design. I hope that this course will allow me to learn and develop new skills and make a mark on
the world of design.Ever since I was a child I've been deeply fascinated by imagery and
image production. Ever since I have taken on my Creative Digital Media course
my love for images has only grown further and further.As you can see from my
work, I am particularly fascinated by the natural world.<br>I spend a lot of time 
and effort trying to get my shots just right. Framed prints are available upon
request. Feel free to visit the contact page for more information.</h4>
